## Pain and problems



Life is difficult.

This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths.[1](#_bookmark103) It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult—once we **truly understand and accept it**—then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

Most do not fully see this truth that life is difficult. Instead they moan more or less incessantly, noisily or subtly, about the enormity of their problems, their burdens, and their difficulties **as if life were generally easy,** as if life *should* be easy. They voice their belief, noisily or subtly, that their difficulties represent a unique kind of affliction that should not be and that has somehow been especially visited upon them, or else upon their families, their tribe, their class, their nation, their race or even their species, and not upon others. I know about this moaning because I have done my share.

Life is a series of problems. Do we want to moan about them or solve them? Do we want to teach our children to solve them?<img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/05/01/taE8upeGjqQ17BX.png" alt="image-20200501145045854" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Discipline is the basic set of tools** we require to solve life’s problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With only some discipline we can solve only some problems. With total discipline we can solve all problems.

What makes life difficult is that **the process of confronting and solving problems is a painful one**. Problems, depending upon their nature, evoke in us frustration or grief or sadness or loneliness or guilt or regret or anger or fear or anxiety or anguish or despair. These are uncomfortable feelings, often very uncomfortable, often as painful as any kind of physical pain, sometimes equaling the very worst kind of physical pain. Indeed, it is *because* of the pain that events or conflicts engender in us all that we call them problems. And since life poses an endless series of problems, life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy.

Yet it is in this whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning. Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure. Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom; indeed, they create our courage and our wisdom. It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually. When we desire to encourage the growth of the human spirit, we challenge and encourage the human capacity to solve problems, just as in school we deliberately set problems for our children to solve. **It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn**. As Benjamin Franklin said, “Those things that hurt, instruct.” It is for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems and actually to welcome the pain of problems.![image-20200501152043026](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/01/5JaiFLtC9ncW13v.png)

Most of us are not so wise. Fearing the pain involved, almost all of us, to a greater or lesser degree, attempt to avoid problems. **We procrastinate, hoping that they will go away.** We ignore them, forget them, pretend they do not exist. We even take drugs to assist us in ignoring them, so that by deadening ourselves to the pain we can forget the problems that cause the pain. We attempt to skirt around problems rather than meet them head on. We attempt to get out of them rather than suffer through them.

![3 Simple Steps You Can Take To Convert Your Procrastination Into ...](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTL8n638NZtkcYmMymkEsFZaJrcuWSNtZO9PzHe61Z5xB_bs62t&usqp=CAU)

![img](file:///C:/Users/52511/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the **primary basis** of all human mental illness. Since most of us have this tendency to a greater or lesser degree, most of us are mentally ill to a greater or lesser degree, l**acking complete mental health.** Some of us will go to quite extraordinary lengths to avoid our problems and the suffering they cause, **proceeding far afield from all that is clearly good and sensible in order to try to find an easy way out,** building the most elaborate fantasies in which to live, sometimes to the total exclusion of reality. In the succinctly elegant words of Carl Jung, “Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.”[2](#_bookmark104)![image-20200501154343503](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/01/PZrDFJwu6EqyB1R.png)

**But the substitute itself ultimately becomes more painful than the legitimate suffering it was designed to avoid.** *The neurosis itself becomes the biggest problem.* True to form, many will then attempt to avoid this pain and this problem in turn, building layer upon layer of neurosis. Fortunately, however, some possess the courage to face their neuroses and begin—usually with the help of psychotherapy—to learn how to experience legitimate suffering. In any case, **when we avoid the legitimate suffering that results from dealing with problems, we also avoid the growth that problems demand from us.** It is for this reason that in chronic mental illness we stop growing, we become stuck. And without healing, the human spirit  begins to shrivel.![image-20200501155634475](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/01/bRJCKiwNTnPV4xG.png)

Therefore let us inculcate in ourselves and in our children the means of achieving mental and spiritual health. By this I mean let us teach ourselves and our children *the **necessity** for suffering and the value thereof,* the need to face problems directly and to experience the pain involved. I have stated that discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life’s problems. It will become clear that these tools are techniques of suffering, means by which we experience the pain of problems in such a way as to work them through and solve them successfully, learning and growing in the process. **When we teach ourselves and our children discipline, we are teaching them and ourselves how to suffer and also how to grow.**

What are these tools, these techniques of suffering, these means of experiencing the pain of problems constructively that I call discipline? There are four: delaying of gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing. As will be evident, these are not complex tools whose application demands extensive training. To the contrary, they are simple tools, and almost all children are adept in their use by the age of ten. Yet presidents and kings will often forget to use them, to their own downfall. The problem lies not in the complexity of these tools but in the will to use them. For they are tools with which pain is confronted rather than avoided, and if one seeks to avoid legitimate suffering, then one will avoid the use of these tools. Therefore, after analyzing each of these tools, we shall in the next section examine the will to use them, which is love.
